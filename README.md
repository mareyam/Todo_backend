Why I chose React?
I chose React to develop this project because of its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable code. React's virtual DOM efficiently updates and renders changes, resulting in fast and performant user interfaces. The extensive React ecosystem provides a wide range of libraries and community support. Additionally, React's declarative syntax and JSX make it intuitive and easy to write and understand code.
